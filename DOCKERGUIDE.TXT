laude -p "How can I run my app with docker windows?"
You already have a `Dockerfile.windows` in your project. Here's how to use it:

### Prerequisites

1. **Docker Desktop for Windows** must be installed and running
2. Docker must be switched to **Windows containers** (right-click the Docker tray icon -> "Switch to Windows containers...")

### Build the image

```powershell
docker build -f Dockerfile.windows -t sleakengine .
```

### Run the container

```powershell
docker run sleakengine
```

Or with custom window size/title arguments:

```powershell
docker run sleakengine C:\src\sleakengine\bin\SleakEngine.exe -w 1280 -h 720 -t My_Game
```

### Important caveats

- **GPU access:** SleakEngine uses DirectX/Vulkan rendering. Standard Windows containers don't have GPU passthrough. You'll need either:
  - **Windows containers with GPU support** (requires Windows Server 2019+ with compatible hardware and `--device` flags or `--gpus` on newer Docker versions)
  - Or run in **software rendering** mode (if your engine supports WARP/Mesa)

- **No display by default:** Windows Server Core has no GUI. For a graphical app you'd typically need to either:
  - Use a `windows` base image instead of `servercore` (though these aren't officially distributed by Microsoft for containers)
  - Run headless / offscreen
  - Use remote display solutions

- **Image size:** The VS build tools + Vulkan SDK + DirectX SDK will make this image very large (20+ GB).

**For development purposes*
